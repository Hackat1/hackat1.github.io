## Current Security Measures

The Vincent Buchan Bookkeeping website is static (HTML/CSS only) and follows industry-recommended security practices:

- âœ… HTTPS enforced via GitHub Pages
- âœ… Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) enabled on the GitHub account
- âœ… Strong GitHub branch protection rules (PRs required for changes, linear history disabled)
- âœ… `Content-Security-Policy` header in use to limit resource loading
- âœ… `Referrer-Policy` set to `no-referrer` to avoid leaking origin data
- âœ… `Permissions-Policy` limits browser feature access
- âœ… No external JavaScript or third-party scripts used
- âœ… `robots.txt` allows crawl access; no sensitive directories present
- âœ… `.well-known/security.txt` implemented (pending full RFC compliance on custom domain)
- âœ… All fonts served via Google Fonts only (no additional external assets)

---

## Planned Improvements

- Add a custom domain name to enable full `.well-known` support
- Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) if/when third-party scripts are used
- Conduct periodic accessibility and security audits as new content is added
