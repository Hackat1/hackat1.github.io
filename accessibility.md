# Accessibility Statement for Vincent Buchan Bookkeeping

Vincent Buchan Bookkeeping is committed to ensuring digital accessibility for all visitors, including individuals with disabilities. We are continuously improving the user experience for everyone and applying relevant accessibility standards.

## Our Commitment

We aim to meet or exceed the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, Level AA** wherever possible. These guidelines explain how to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities and more user-friendly for everyone.

## What We've Done

The VBBK website is designed and built using semantic HTML and accessible design patterns. Some key accessibility features include:

- Proper use of heading hierarchy, with a visible `<h1>` on each page
- Responsive design with readable font sizes and color contrast that meets WCAG 2.1 AA thresholds
- Navigation that works with keyboard and assistive technologies
- Descriptive `alt` text on all images
- Clean, high-contrast text on a light background for legibility
- Use of `aria-label` and other attributes where appropriate
- A strict Content Security Policy (CSP) that enhances site security while maintaining accessible structure

## Known Limitations

- The site has not yet been tested with screen readers or assistive technology beyond automated tools.
- User feedback mechanisms are currently limited to email.

We are actively working to improve these areas.
